# immersiveparticipatoryliveperformance
This 2-day lab will examine the role the body plays in social change processes. Weâ€™ll explore different live performance-techniques and performance systems across dance, theatre and performance art that incorporate actors/non-actors, multi-media and emerging technology to create issue-driven, participatory mixed-reality experiences incorporating generative audio and visual, responsive environments, sensors, virtual and augmented reality, location-based triggers and machine vision. Students will be introduced to Touch Designer, Qlab, Isadora and other real-time performance environments.
